# CloudLab Infrastructure

CloudLab is a personal learning environment focused on building enterprise-grade infrastructure on Microsoft Azure using Terraform.  
The goal of this project is to simulate how a modern organization would design, provision, and manage its cloud platform using Infrastructure-as-Code and DevOps best practices.
